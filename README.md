# Stack Overflow Tag Prediction

![Stack Overflow Logo](stack-over-flow.jpg)

## Overview

Welcome to the "Stack Overflow Tag Prediction" repository! This project is dedicated to predicting tags (or labels) for questions posted on Stack Overflow. The primary objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of automatically assigning relevant tags to user-submitted questions. This prediction system aims to simplify the process of finding answers and experts in specific topics on the platform.

## Why Tag Prediction Matters:

Effective tagging is essential on Stack Overflow to ensure that questions reach the right audience and receive accurate responses. However, manual tagging can be cumbersome and time-consuming for users. Our project tackles this challenge by automating the tagging process, making it easier for both question askers and answerers to navigate the vast knowledge repository of Stack Overflow.

## The Impact: 

With accurate tag predictions, users can find answers to their questions more quickly, and experts can discover questions aligned with their expertise. This leads to a more efficient and collaborative community, ultimately enhancing the Stack Overflow experience for everyone.

6. Train and evaluate the tag prediction model using the dataset and code.

## Dataset 
We used a Kaggle dataset for our project.

## Model
Our approach involves employing machine learning techniques, including natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms, to predict tags for Stack Overflow questions. The model is trained on historical question data and can predict relevant tags based on the content of the questions.

## Results
For detailed insights into the model's performance and evaluation metrics, please refer to the Jupyter notebook. We continuously strive to enhance the model's accuracy and efficiency.
